THINGS TO DO:
_____________________________________________________________________

* Add 'Robot development environment'

* Add graphical map designer.

* In version 2.0, more creatures will get added. The things called
  "baddie" and "food" and "prize" will be generic descriptors.  For
  example, "food" will be a generic name for "cookie" or "donut", so
  that (robot-feel 'cookie) will fail if the thing is a donut, but
  (robot-feel 'food) will still work.
