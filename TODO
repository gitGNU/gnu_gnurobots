THINGS TO DO:
_____________________________________________________________________

* Improve the graphics, to make everything look better.  I think I
  need a graphic designer to help me do this.  GTK+ would be nice.

* In version 2.0, more creatures will get added.  The things called
  "baddie" and "food" and "prize" will be generic descriptors.  For
  example, "food" will be a generic name for "cookie" or "donut", so
  that (robot-feel 'cookie) will fail if the thing is a donut, but
  (robot-feel 'food) will still work.
