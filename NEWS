RELEASE HISTORY FOR GNU ROBOTS:
_____________________________________________________________________

1.2.0 Gtk UI Release.

      Move UI away from Xlib to Gtk.
      Add Vte for interactive input.
      Brand new graphics courtesy of Eric P. Hutchins.
      Various minor bugfixes.
      Marks the beginnings of the fully fledged 'Robot development
      environment'.

1.1.0 Bug fix release.

      Improve GUI, including proper handling of X events.
      Scrap plug-able UI's in preparation for GTK GUI.
      General clean up.

1.0D  Added some extra documentation (but not much) and the early
      beginning of code clean-up.

1.0C  Pawel <uzturnau@cyf-kr.edu.pl> fixed a bug where the robot was
      not able to smell anything to the east or west.

      Fixed a few other bugs.

      Moving the robot around and zapping things and picking things up
      just got a little more expensive.  If you are running an old
      robot under GNU Robots 1.0, you may notice that your robot won't
      last as long.  I think the new energy "costs" will challenge
      people to write more efficient robot programs.

      Removed scm_random and scm_randomize, since the random function
      is now provided in GNU Guile 1.3.  If you are trying to run GNU
      Robots under GNU Guile 1.2 or previous, you will need to patch
      it yourself using the src/random.c source file.

      Ran all the .c files through GNU Indent.  Sorry about not having
      done that before, everyone.

      Added more comments to the sample robot programs.

      Tim Northover contributed a GNU Robots map editor.  I have put
      this in the `contrib' directory.

_____________________________________________________________________

0.95 - Applied several patches from Steinar Hamre
       <steinarh@stud.fim.ntnu.no> that fix how `configure' locates
       GNU Guile.  No feature enhancements.

0.91 - Fixed a few annoying bugs.  No feature enhancements.

0.9  - Used GNU Autoconf to configure the source for various platforms.
       Made robot variables into `long', improved command line using
       `getopt', and added Scheme functions to check robot status.
       Also, included some sample robots that were submitted.

0.8  - Added GNU Getopt to scan command line.  Added contributions for
       X Windows interface, and added cooler XPMs.  Changed build
       target names, to be more descriptive.  Added html
       documentation.

0.77 - Added 'random' and 'randomize' functions.  Redefined 'exit' and
       'quit' to exit nicely.  Some tweaking to initial energy.

0.76 - Added code to stop the game when the robot runs out of energy
       or shields fall to zero.  Reduced globals to only main.c and
       api.c.  Now builds both the curses and log-file game for 'make
       all'.

0.72 - Fixed a bug during movement.  Added a new sample robot.  First
       release when the game engine actually seems to work.  Does not
       stop the game when the robot is dead, though.
