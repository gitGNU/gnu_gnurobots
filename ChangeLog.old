	* src/main.c src/api.c include/api.h include/main.h:
		Converted to the newer scm_* API.

2004-10-22  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zeenix@gmail.com>
	* lib/cures.c lib/x11.c lib/text.c
	  lib/curesplugin.c lib/x11plugin.c lib/textplugin.c
	  lib/curesplugin.h lib/x11plugin.h lib/textplugin.h lib/Makefile.am:
	  	The plugins are also gobjectized now, at last. Had to rename
		them and create header files for them.
	* include/userinterface.h src/userinterface.c:
		The userinterface module is no longer a modules loader but
		an (gobject) interface that all display plugins MUST
		implement.
	* src/main.c:
		The module loading/unloading has been moved to the main
		module. Also needed to update the interaction with userinterface
		module.
	* configure.ac:
		We needed properties in interfaces which wasn't supported
		before glib <= 2.4.

2004-10-1  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zeenix@gmail.com>
	* configure.ac include/userinterface.h src/userinterface.c:
		replaced ltdl with gmodule. You have no idea how much I love
		glib :)

	  src/Makefile.am src/grobot.c src/main.c src/userinterface.c
	  src/map.c:
	  	GObjectized Map code too. Now remains the plugins, but who
		will bell the cat? :)
	* src/grobot.c:
		Act appropriatelly on NULLs rather than g_return_if_fail in
		_set_property.


2004-09-24  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zeenix@gmail.com>

	* include/configs.h include/main.h src/grobot.c
	  src/main.c userinterface.c:
		BUGFIX: a refcounting problem because of which the UI module
		did'nt get the chance to destroy itself and you know damn well
		what this would mean for the curses user. :)

2004-09-10  Wojciech Polak

	* src/main.c: Changed some printing style (help, version, and etc.).

2004-08-26  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zeenix@gmail.com>

	* TODO: Removed things already solved/implemented.
	* lib/curses.c lib/text.c lib/x11.c
	  src/userinterface.c src/main.c src/grobot.c include/userinterface.h:
		Expanded the userinterface api to fix a problem I introduced in
		the x11 plugin.

2004-08-22  Wojciech Polak

	* configure.ac: Added AC_PREREQ.
	  Require at least GNU Autoconf 2.59.

	* include/grobot.h include/robots.h src/grobot.c src/robots.c
	  include/Makefile.am src/Makefile.am 
	  src/api.c src/loadmap.c src/main.c:
	  	Renamed robots module to grobot to make it compatible with 
		the name of the object: GRobot.

2004-08-21  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zeenix@gmail.com>

	Most of the modules have successfully be gobject-ized, except for the 
	Map loader and the plugins (which is a bit tricky).

2004-07-27  Wojciech Polak

	Now we can just use `make dist' to create the tarball.

	* contrib/Makefile.am: Added new file.
	* doc/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* getopt/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* include/Makefile.am: Likewise.

2004-07-25  Wojciech Polak

	* configure.ac: Renamed from configure.in and slightly improved.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added `build'.

2004-07-24  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* include/userinterface.h src/userinterface.c:
		Rename ui.* to userinterface.* to make it compatible with the
		name change of the module (now an object) itself.

2004-07-23  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* include/ui.h src/ui.c:
		Some changes to the UI object.

2004-07-20  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in:
		First phase of OOPizing everything. We now require gobject 
		too.
	* include/ui.h src/ui.c src/main.c src/api.c:
		The UI module is now implemented as an object.

2004-07-18  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in Makefile.am lib/Makefile.am:
		Plugins are now compiled CONDITIONALLY.

2004-07-17  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in src/Makefile.am:
		We should rely on the guile provided autoconf macros rather 
		than our own tests

2004-07-16  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* lib/curses.c lib/x11.c:
		The robot should'nt just JUMP but move from one block to
		another.
	* src/main.c src/robots.c:
		The list of robots is now implemented as a Doubly-Linked List
		and not a static array.

2004-07-15  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* lib/*.c src/main.c src/drawmap.c src/display.c
	  include/drawmap.h include/display.h
	  src/Makefile.am:
	  	Removed drawmap module and shifted it's functionality into
		the UI module. The previous change did'nt actually solved
		the problem it was supposed to, but this one does. 
		Although this too does'nt solves the turning problem :(.
	* lib/x11.c:
		Solved the problem of turning not being animated in the x11 
		module.
	* include/display.h include/ui.h
	  src/api.c src/main.c src/display.c src/ui.c
	  src/Makefile.am:
	  	Changed the name of module 'display' to 'ui'.

2004-07-13  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* lib/x11.c:
		BUGFIX: zaping and grapping did'nt used to be animated before
		the robot-moved. Robot turning has a simillar problem but I'll
		have a look at it tomorrow.

2004-07-12  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* maps/Makefile.am scheme/Makefile.am src/Makefile.am Makefile.am 
	  configure.in include/configs.h :
		Build-system install is now aware of data files
	* bootstrap.sh:
		bootstrap.sh now runs the configure script with no options

2004-07-10  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* bootstrap.sh:
		Simplied the bootstrap process by using: autoreconf -fisv
	* src/drawmap.c:
		BUGFIX: replaced hook_add_thing with newer display_add_thing. 
		display should really be changed to UI.

2004-07-08  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* bootstrap.sh configure.in 
	  include/hooks.h include/display.h include/api.h 
	  src/Makefile.am src/api.c src/display.c src/main.c
	  lib/Makefile.am lib/text.c lib/curses.c lib/x11.c:
	  	1 UI is now implemented as dynamically loaded modules
		  -> plugins. Also added a switch by which user can
		  specify the module to use. Otherwise grobots shall
		  choose the best available (x11 if env varriable DISPLAY
		  is defined, curses otherwise).
		 
		2 There is ONLY one binary now: grobots

		3 User dont need to provide full path to the maps or scheme 
	          file. The pkgdatadir and the path declared through the 
		  Env varriables GNU_ROBOTS_MAPS_PATH and
		  GNU_ROBOTS_SCRIPTS_PATH are searched for the file.

2004-07-03  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* configure.ac lib/Makefile.am src/Makefile.am:
		Start to use libtool.

2004-07-01  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* *.h *.c:
		Some minor chages and first phase of GLIBization.

2004-06-30  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* curses.c:
		Some minor changes.
	* bootstrap.sh configure.in Makefile.am src/Makefile.am lib/Makefile.am
	  Makefile.in src/Makefile.in lib/Makefile.in:
	  	Now we also use automake

2004-06-29  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* hooks.h curses.c text.c x11.c main.c:
		Added another function hook_put_string. Using it, added
		code to throw the exceptions caught during interractive mode 
		to the display.
			
2004-06-28  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* curses.c:
		Added Colors. Let there be light!
	* api.h curses.c x11.c:
		Fixed some timing stuff
	* api.h *.map:
		A space is now repressented by a space, both in maps and
		on the cureses-based display.
	* main.c x11.c text.c curses.c:
		Added interactive mode. If the scheme file is not specified,
		we go into an interactive mode. I'll improve on it tomorrow.

2004-06-27  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* api.h api.c:
		Removed a bug i introduced
	
	* random.h random.c:

		Corrected some build problems.


2004-06-27  Zeeshan Ali Khattak <zak147@yahoo.com>

	* *.c *.h: 
		Ran gstreamer provided script gst-indent to indent all the
		source files according to what most of the people use rather
		than strictly following the GNU Coding Standards.

	* api.h text.c:
		defined a global array of strings to translate the directions
		to strings
	
	* scheme/*.scm:
		Changed some minor stuff in nice scripts writen a little badly
